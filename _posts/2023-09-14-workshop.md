- title: "Bayesian Surrogate Modelling of Computer Experiments using Gaussian Processes "
  abstract: "Computer simulations/experiments of complicated physical processes are a cost-effective way of investigating input-output relationships. Though they provide an efficiency gain when compared to in-situ or laboratory experiments, computer simulations can still be very time- and computationally expensive. Surrogate models can alleviate this expense and Gaussian processes have recently been widely used in emulating computer experiments in particular. In this work, Gaussian processes are used to emulate deterioration of large infrastructure assets, such as transport cuttings. The emulation allows to approximate the relationship between deterioration and earthwork properties, e.g. height, slope angle, and soil strength. As the resulting Gaussian model is hierarchical, it can have hundreds of parameters that need to be optimised for which we use Bayesian modelling. The resulting model can be used in real time to estimate the extent of earthwork deterioration and has the potential to inform slope maintenance and design."

- title: "Identifying Dynamic Systems for Digital Twins of Engineering Assets "
  abstract: "The pursuit of greater levels of virtualisation and integration of data and models in engineering is currently expressed as the desire to construct a digital twin of an asset. This twin is then used to inform operational and maintenance decisions, assist in design and planning and provide greater insight into performance. One key challenge is ensuring that the twin accurately reproduces the behaviour of the physical structure. This aim can be approached via physical modelling, data-driven methods or a combination of the two. This talk will focus on one task within the wider framework, that of identifying dynamic systems (those governed by ordinary or partial differential equations) from data whilst respecting prior knowledge about the system. The tool of choice will be the Gaussian process (GP) which provides a flexible Bayesian framework in which to conduct this identification. Challenges are associated with the use of the GP, namely that in its standard form it will only learn "static" maps from inputs to outputs so cannot be directly applied to dynamic data. It will be shown how, in the setting of dynamic system identification, the GP can still be a powerful and valuable tool. Of particular interest, will be how the GP allows for encoding of engineering knowledge in the structure of the model to allow for more efficient identification than a purely black-box approach."
